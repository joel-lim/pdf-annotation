# How to Use

This assumes that you have activated the virtualenv and installed the relevant libraries in the [main README](../README.md)
1. Run `main.py`
2. You can find the output of the textbook with the table of contents and index under the [outputs](./outputs) folder.
3. The script will use the textbook in the outputs directory and upload it to a page numbering service. The file will then be downloaded to the folder that [this README](.) resides in.
